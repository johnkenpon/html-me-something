                        These are pictures I've taken and edited over the past few years. Is it art? I don't know and don't necessarily care but I do find some amusement when looking at them.

                        During the summertime at my current place of employment, fruit flies tend to swarm in droves through the wide open warehouse dock doors. My coworker Bob, a short, stout ARMY vet with an ego as big as his stomach, has a simple solution to this pest problem; a little cocktail of vinegar and a dash of dishsoap. Curious as to how effective this fly trap was, I lifted the small dish of poison and saw what looked like a swarm of fruit flies flying about on a cloudy day.

                    <p>
                        A few years back, a large sum pears mysteriously showed up on my doorstep. For a straight week, my diet consisted of bartlett pears and Nongshim Black Label Ramen Noodles(never settle for Cup Noodle), which was a 5 star meal for me that at the time. I could never imagine myself ever getting sick of eating this meal....until I did. All but one lonely pear had been consumed, and I could not bring myself to eat it. So to honor this fruit and commemorate my week spent with it, I decided take a pen to it and give it a face. Weeks later, the pear turned to the consistancy of pudding. So I climbed a few stairs and let it drop onto a nice sheet of paper.

                        Each month at my current place of employment, we all get corraled into a drab conference room like just sheared sheep, to celebrate employee birthday's. At these gatherings, subpar cake and icecream or icecream cake is served, preceded by a rather depressing rendition of the classic birthday anthem, Happy Birthday To You, followed by awkward conversations fueled by faux enthusiasm. The sweetest part is when it ends.

                        The mason jar I drink from on a day to day basis, sweat and sat on the same folded Bounty paper towel for damn near a year. One day, I notice there was specks of some type of mold starting to take form, so, I decided to take a picture of it. After some magic and photo manipulation courtesy of my Iphone, the once black mold took on the many colors that you see here.

                        My hand was smudged with green quick dry paint and red from a day at the shop. Again, with the magic of the wizards at Apple, I was able to exaggerate these colors and textures to what seems to resemble a weather radar and/or topographical map. As weather weathers the Earth, work/life weathers people.

                        A dear friend of mine had a bad habit of leaving unwashed silverware out on her "would-not-pass-inspection" second floor balcony, after meals of Kraft Easy Mac and canned tuna. Smoking a cigarette on the deathtrap the morning after a night of negligence and debauchery, I sat and stared cheesily at a cheese crusted fork, sitting in a puddle of yesterday evening.

                        In 2016, I took a plane across the water for a European excursion. Edinburgh, Scotland was the second stop on said excursion. Swaying around the city, more than a little buzzed off an array of varying scotches and heavy with a stomach full of haggis, I stumbled upon a little place called Camera Obscura. The castlelike building was a museum devoted to everything illusionary and trippy. It was there, that I came in contact with God.
